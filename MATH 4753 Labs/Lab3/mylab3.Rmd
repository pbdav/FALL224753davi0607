# Tasks

## Task 1

Getting the Working Direcotry

```{r}
getwd()
```

## Task 2  
This is where I read in the SPRUCE data:

```{r}

dird="C:\\RPACKAGES\\FALL224753davi0607\\MATH 4753 Labs\\Lab3\\"

myread=function(csv){
  fl=paste(dird,csv,sep="")
  read.table(fl,header=TRUE,sep=",")
}

spruce.df=myread("SPRUCE.csv")#MS pg478


#First six lines:
head(spruce.df)

```






## Task 3  

### Initial Scatter Plot

This is the initial scatter plot of the data (x=BHDiameter, y=Height)



```{r}
with(spruce.df,  
  plot(Height~BHDiameter,bg="Blue",pch=21,ylim=c(0,1.1*max(Height)),
      xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)), main = "Initial Scatter Plot", cex = 1.2))

```

Based on this plot, I would be open to saying that there appears to either be a very weak straight line relationship, or possibly a quadratic relationship could be applied as well.

### Trendscatter Plots (f=0.5,0.6,0.7)

```{r}
#Load in the s20x package
library(s20x)

#Create the layout
layout(matrix(1:3, nr=1, nc = 3, byrow = TRUE))

layout.show(3)

#Create the trendscatter plots
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter,f=0.5, data=spruce.df, main = "Height vs. BHDiameter")
mtext("f=0.5", side = 3)
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter,f=0.6, data=spruce.df, main = "Height vs. BHDiameter")
mtext("f=0.6", side = 3)
trendscatter(Height~BHDiameter,f=0.7, data=spruce.df, main = "Height vs. BHDiameter")
mtext("f=0.7", side = 3)


```

### Straight Line Relationship Plot

```{r}
# Making a linear model
spruce.lm=with(spruce.df, lm(Height~BHDiameter))

#Making the new scatter plot
with(spruce.df, 
     plot(Height~BHDiameter,bg="Blue",pch=21,ylim=c(0,1.1*max(Height)),xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)), main = "New Scatter Plot of Height vs. BHDiameter")
)


#Plotting a least squares regression line
abline(spruce.lm)
```

For this graph, I don't think a straight line is appropriate! When plotted against the data, you can pretty clearly see a curve in the data from the leftmost data point to the rightmost data point. When I look at the smoother curve plots, every regression line has some sort of a curve in it, which leads me to believe that a curved best fit line would be better accustomed to this data set versus a straight line.

## Task 4 

### Four Plots

```{r}
layout(matrix(1:4, nr=2, nc = 2, byrow = TRUE))
layout.show(4)

#FIRST PLOT

with(spruce.df, 
     plot(Height~BHDiameter,bg="Blue",pch=21,ylim=c(0,1.1*max(Height)),xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)))
)
abline(spruce.lm)

#SECOND PLOT

with(spruce.df, 
     plot(Height~BHDiameter,bg="Blue",pch=21,ylim=c(0,1.1*max(Height)),xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)))
)
abline(spruce.lm)
#Make the yhat values 
yhat=fitted(spruce.lm)

# Draw in the segments making the residuals
with(spruce.df,{
  segments(BHDiameter,Height,BHDiameter,yhat)
})

#THIRD PLOT

with(spruce.df, 
     plot(Height~BHDiameter,bg="Blue",pch=21,ylim=c(0,1.1*max(Height)),xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)))
)

#plot mean of height line and regression line
with(spruce.df, abline(h=mean(Height)))
abline(spruce.lm)

#make the deviations of the fitted line and mean line
with(spruce.df, segments(BHDiameter,mean(Height),BHDiameter,yhat))

#FOURTH PLOT

with(spruce.df, 
     plot(Height~BHDiameter,bg="Blue",pch=21,ylim=c(0,1.1*max(Height)),xlim=c(0,1.1*max(BHDiameter)))
)

#plot mean of height line
with(spruce.df,abline(h=mean(Height)))

#plot deviation columns of the mean line
with(spruce.df, segments(BHDiameter,Height,BHDiameter,mean(Height)))



```

### Calculating Values RSS, MSS, and TSS, and interpreting values

```{r}
#residual sum of squares
RSS=with(spruce.df,sum((Height-yhat)^2))
RSS

#model sum of squares
MSS=with(spruce.df,sum((yhat-mean(Height))^2))
MSS

#total sum of squares
TSS=with(spruce.df,sum((Height-mean(Height))^2))
TSS
```

Here are some other required calculations:
```{r}
MSS/TSS
```
This number of MSS/TSS represents how well the model fits the data, as the calculation for MSS/TSS is equal to R^2 (MSS/TSS=R^2), our correlation coefficient. In the case of this data, we can say there is a moderate correlation between Height and BHDiameter, due to our R^2 value of .6569146.

```{r}
TSS
RSS+MSS
```

As you can see, the sum of RSS and MSS are equal to TSS.


## Task 5

### Summary/Equation of Best Fit Line

Here is the summary for spruce.lm
```{r}
summary(spruce.lm)
coef(spruce.lm)

#Slope coefficient: .48147
#Intercept coefficient: 9.14684
#Equation: Height = 9.14684 + .48147*BHDiameter
```
The coefficients can be found in the 'Estimates' column, or under the results produced by the coef() method. The estimated slope is 0.48147, while the estimated intercept is 9.14684  
Therefore, the equation of the fitted line made by spruce.lm is:
Height = 9.146839 + .4814743 * BHDiameter

### Prediction of Height of Spruce at Preset Diameters

```{r}
#predict height at 15, 18, 20 cm
predict(spruce.lm, data.frame(BHDiameter=c(15,18,20)))
```

So then, we can see that for the tree with a 15 cm diameter, the predicted height is 16.37, for the tree with the 18 cm diameter, the predicted height is 17.81, and for the tree with the 20 cm diameter, the predicted height is 18.78

## Task 6 

Making a gg plot of the data:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
g=ggplot(spruce.df, aes(x=BHDiameter,y=Height, color=Height))
g=g+geom_point() + geom_line()+ geom_smooth(method="lm")
g+ggtitle("Height vs BHDiameter")


```
